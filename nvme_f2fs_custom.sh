MOUNT OPTIONS
================================================================================

background_gc=%s       Turn on/off cleaning operations, namely garbage
                       collection, triggered in background when I/O subsystem is
                       idle. If background_gc=on, it will turn on the garbage
                       collection and if background_gc=off, garbage collection
                       will be turned off. If background_gc=sync, it will turn
                       on synchronous garbage collection running in background.
                       Default value for this option is on. So garbage
                       collection is on by default.
disable_roll_forward   Disable the roll-forward recovery routine
norecovery             Disable the roll-forward recovery routine, mounted read-
                       only (i.e., -o ro,disable_roll_forward)
discard/nodiscard      Enable/disable real-time discard in f2fs, if discard is
                       enabled, f2fs will issue discard/TRIM commands when a
		       segment is cleaned.
no_heap                Disable heap-style segment allocation which finds free
                       segments for data from the beginning of main area, while
		       for node from the end of main area.
nouser_xattr           Disable Extended User Attributes. Note: xattr is enabled
                       by default if CONFIG_F2FS_FS_XATTR is selected.
noacl                  Disable POSIX Access Control List. Note: acl is enabled
                       by default if CONFIG_F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL is selected.
active_logs=%u         Support configuring the number of active logs. In the
                       current design, f2fs supports only 2, 4, and 6 logs.
                       Default number is 6.
disable_ext_identify   Disable the extension list configured by mkfs, so f2fs
                       does not aware of cold files such as media files.
inline_xattr           Enable the inline xattrs feature.
noinline_xattr         Disable the inline xattrs feature.
inline_xattr_size=%u   Support configuring inline xattr size, it depends on
		       flexible inline xattr feature.
inline_data            Enable the inline data feature: New created small(<~3.4k)
                       files can be written into inode block.
inline_dentry          Enable the inline dir feature: data in new created
                       directory entries can be written into inode block. The
                       space of inode block which is used to store inline
                       dentries is limited to ~3.4k.
noinline_dentry        Disable the inline dentry feature.
flush_merge	       Merge concurrent cache_flush commands as much as possible
                       to eliminate redundant command issues. If the underlying
		       device handles the cache_flush command relatively slowly,
		       recommend to enable this option.
nobarrier              This option can be used if underlying storage guarantees
                       its cached data should be written to the novolatile area.
		       If this option is set, no cache_flush commands are issued
		       but f2fs still guarantees the write ordering of all the
		       data writes.
fastboot               This option is used when a system wants to reduce mount
                       time as much as possible, even though normal performance
		       can be sacrificed.
extent_cache           Enable an extent cache based on rb-tree, it can cache
                       as many as extent which map between contiguous logical
                       address and physical address per inode, resulting in
                       increasing the cache hit ratio. Set by default.
noextent_cache         Disable an extent cache based on rb-tree explicitly, see
                       the above extent_cache mount option.
noinline_data          Disable the inline data feature, inline data feature is
                       enabled by default.
data_flush             Enable data flushing before checkpoint in order to
                       persist data of regular and symlink.
reserve_root=%d        Support configuring reserved space which is used for
                       allocation from a privileged user with specified uid or
                       gid, unit: 4KB, the default limit is 0.2% of user blocks.
resuid=%d              The user ID which may use the reserved blocks.
resgid=%d              The group ID which may use the reserved blocks.
fault_injection=%d     Enable fault injection in all supported types with
                       specified injection rate.
fault_type=%d          Support configuring fault injection type, should be
                       enabled with fault_injection option, fault type value
                       is shown below, it supports single or combined type.

                       FAULT_WRITE_IO		0x000004000
mode=%s                Control block allocation mode which supports "adaptive"
                       and "lfs". In "lfs" mode, there should be no random
                       writes towards main area.
io_bits=%u             Set the bit size of write IO requests. It should be set
                       with "mode=lfs".
usrquota               Enable plain user disk quota accounting.
grpquota               Enable plain group disk quota accounting.
prjquota               Enable plain project quota accounting.
usrjquota=<file>       Appoint specified file and type during mount, so that quota
grpjquota=<file>       information can be properly updated during recovery flow,
prjjquota=<file>       <quota file>: must be in root directory;
jqfmt=<quota type>     <quota type>: [vfsold,vfsv0,vfsv1].
offusrjquota           Turn off user journelled quota.
offgrpjquota           Turn off group journelled quota.
offprjjquota           Turn off project journelled quota.
quota                  Enable plain user disk quota accounting.
noquota                Disable all plain disk quota option.
whint_mode=%s          Control which write hints are passed down to block
                       layer. This supports "off", "user-based", and
                       "fs-based".  In "off" mode (default), f2fs does not pass
                       down hints. In "user-based" mode, f2fs tries to pass
                       down hints given by users. And in "fs-based" mode, f2fs
                       passes down hints with its policy.
alloc_mode=%s          Adjust block allocation policy, which supports "reuse"
                       and "default".
fsync_mode=%s          Control the policy of fsync. Currently supports "posix",
                       "strict", and "nobarrier". In "posix" mode, which is
                       default, fsync will follow POSIX semantics and does a
                       light operation to improve the filesystem performance.
                       In "strict" mode, fsync will be heavy and behaves in line
                       with xfs, ext4 and btrfs, where xfstest generic/342 will
                       pass, but the performance will regress. "nobarrier" is
                       based on "posix", but doesn't issue flush command for
                       non-atomic files likewise "nobarrier" mount option.
test_dummy_encryption  Enable dummy encryption, which provides a fake fscrypt
                       context. The fake fscrypt context is used by xfstests.
checkpoint=%s[:%u[%]]     Set to "disable" to turn off checkpointing. Set to "enable"
                       to reenable checkpointing. Is enabled by default. While
                       disabled, any unmounting or unexpected shutdowns will cause
                       the filesystem contents to appear as they did when the
                       filesystem was mounted with that option.
                       While mounting with checkpoint=disabled, the filesystem must
                       run garbage collection to ensure that all available space can
                       be used. If this takes too much time, the mount may return
                       EAGAIN. You may optionally add a value to indicate how much
                       of the disk you would be willing to temporarily give up to
                       avoid additional garbage collection. This can be given as a
                       number of blocks, or as a percent. For instance, mounting
                       with checkpoint=disable:100% would always succeed, but it may
                       hide up to all remaining free space. The actual space that
                       would be unusable can be viewed at /sys/fs/f2fs/<disk>/unusable
                       This space is reclaimed once checkpoint=enable.
compress_algorithm=%s  Control compress algorithm, currently f2fs supports "lzo"
                       and "lz4" algorithm.
compress_log_size=%u   Support configuring compress cluster size, the size will
                       be 4KB * (1 << %u), 16KB is minimum size, also it's
                       default size.
compress_extension=%s  Support adding specified extension, so that f2fs can enable
                       compression on those corresponding files, e.g. if all files
                       with '.ext' has high compression rate, we can set the '.ext'
                       on compression extension list and enable compression on
                       these file by default rather than to enable it via ioctl.
                       For other files, we can still enable compression via ioctl.
